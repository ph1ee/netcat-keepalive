# makefile for netcat, based off same ol' "generic makefile".
# Usually do "make systype" -- if your systype isn't defined, try "generic"
# or something else that most closely matches, see where it goes wrong, fix
# it, and MAIL THE DIFFS back to Hobbit.

### PREDEFINES

# DEFAULTS, possibly overridden by <systype> recursive call:
# pick gcc if you'd rather , and/or do -g instead of -O if debugging
# debugging
# DFLAGS = -DTEST -DDEBUG
CFLAGS = -O
XFLAGS = 	# xtra cflags, set by systype targets
XLIBS =		# xtra libs if necessary?
# -Bstatic for sunos,  -static for gcc, etc.  You want this, trust me.
STATIC =
CC = cc $(CFLAGS)
LD = $(CC) -s	# linker; defaults to stripped executables
o = o		# object extension
OBJ = nckl

ALL = nc

### BOGON-CATCHERS

bogus:
	@echo "Usage:  make  <systype>  [options]"

### HARD TARGETS

nc:	netcat.c
	$(LD) $(DFLAGS) $(XFLAGS) $(STATIC) -o $(OBJ) *.c $(XLIBS)

nc-dos:
	@echo "DOS?!  Maybe someday, but not now"

### SYSTYPES -- in the same order as in generic.h, please
